      "description": "This Python code is my Sudoku solver. The solver can solve Sudoku games ranging from easy to what is claimed to be the hardest Sudoku puzzle invented. The solver uses standard Sudoku logic to solve all but the hardest games. For the hardest games and having exhausted standard logic, the solver maintains a stack of exploratory moves to attempt to solve the game.",

The app runs on iPhone and Android and accesses the user's current location and orientation to provide property addresses and valuation details for properties as you walk by them. The app also allows the user to view properties within an adjustable radius of their location. The app utilizes Google mapping APIs and Zillow's property valuations APIs.",
